          <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
          <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as a part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
          <d1>
              <dt>Burpees</dt>
              <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and the forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
              
              <dt>Plank</dt>
              <dd>Planks build your core strength. To preform a plank, get in a puch up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>
              
              <dt>Monutain Climber</dt>
              <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a puch up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
